## ðŸš§ Work in Progress

This library is currently in an alpha state. The API is highly unstable and subject to breaking  
changes without notice. It has not been thoroughly tested, and there may be critical bugs. Due to   
its early development status, its use may be insecure and could lead to loss of funds or other   
assets. It is intended for experimentation and feedback only and should not be used in a   
production environment.
